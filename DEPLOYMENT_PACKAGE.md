# üöÄ DEPLOYMENT PACKAGE: Deals Permission Fix

## üìã **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Issue**: Permission denied (42501) errors on Deals page preventing all CRUD operations
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent data fetching between Deals (custom function) and Proposals (useOptimizedData hook)
**Solution**: Convert Deals page to use same `useOptimizedData` pattern as working Proposals page
**Status**: ‚úÖ **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

---

## üîß **EXACT FILE CHANGES REQUIRED**

### **File**: `crmnew-main/app/dashboard/deals/page.tsx`

**CRITICAL CHANGE**: Replace the entire file content with the fixed version that uses `useOptimizedData` hook.

The key changes are:
1. **Remove**: Custom `fetchDeals` function and related state management
2. **Add**: `useOptimizedData<Deal>({ table: "deals", requiresAuth: true })` 
3. **Update**: All data operations to use the optimized hook
4. **Maintain**: All existing UI components and functionality
